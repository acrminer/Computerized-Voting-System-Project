# Computerized-Voting-System-Project

Implement a computerized voting system to accomplish three tasks: use the
speed and accuracy of computers to have nearly instantaneous, error free results
and provide an auditable trail for recounts when disputes arise over the outcome of
an election all while preserving the anonymity of the voter. The system addresses
the official requirements as stated by the ACM as well as other requirements
pertinent to a redundant, reliable and verifiable system.
